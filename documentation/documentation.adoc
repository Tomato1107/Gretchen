= Gretchen Assembly Documentation

This is the Gretchen assembly manual. Following these steps will enable you to build your humanoid robot from the assembly kit.

=== Tool and Part List
Before starting the assembly. Check that you have all the tools and parts in place.


== Recommended Tools

You will need these tools to assemble the Gretchen robot.

* Allen keys (hex drivers)
** M1.6 (bearing set screws)
** M2   (belt tensioners)
** M4   (motors and bearings)

* Ring spanner M8 for joints
* Small Phillips screw driver
* Soldering iron with a fine tip for motor assembly
* Brushes for painting the parts
* Tweezers for motor control board assembly
* Flat-nosed pliers or a crimp tool for custom cabling

* Sandpaper or files
* Clamps (5-10) for glueing parts together

* Acrylic paint (< 0.5mÂ², color of your choice)
* Acrylic clear coat

*For self-manufacturing the body parts:*

* Lab or home quality 3D printer, e.g. Ultimaker using ABS or tough PLA filament
* Laser cutting or milling machine for the wooden parts



== 3D Printed parts

* 10x Tooth Belt Pulleys with DSpline connector
* 2x Tooth Belt Pulleys with M8 Hex nut connector
* 2x hip axel connector with integrated pulleys
* 2x knee inner (L/R)
* 2x knee outer (L/R) with integrated pulleys
* 2x foot (L/R)
* 2x ankle cardan gimbal
* 2x Tooth Belt Pulleys for 4x M4 screws connector
* *TODO:*

*For self-manufacture your robot's body parts:*

Home or Lab Quality printers shall suffice. Print with "Tough" PLA or ABS Plastic using 20% infill for the parts.
Print using 0.1 mm layer height for parts that contain pulleys (tooth belts need precision here). Print using 0.2 mm layers for all other parts. We recommend using water soluble support structure if available.

When using professional 3D-printing service, consider SLS (Selective Laser Sintering).


== Laser Cut parts

== Mechanical Standard parts

== Electronic parts

* 10x Sensorimotors
* 10x Servo Motors Hitec HS-805MG
* Acceleration Sensor (ADXL345) Breakout board GY-291
* 2x Termination Resistor 220 Ohm
* Cables according to the list below

=== Cable lengths

[cols=2*,options=header]
|===
| Name          | Length
| thigh-2-shank | 42cm
| shank-2-foot  | 38cm
| hip-2-thigh   | 42cm
| hip-2-hip     | 16cm
| thigh-2-thigh | 16cm

== Glueing

The wooden parts are approx. 5mm thick. Each Gretchen body part (lower torso, thigh or shank) is composed of two 5mm wooden plates glued together to reach the 10mm needed. Hence, in your assembly kit you should have 4x shank, 4x thigh, 2x torso plates.

=== Prepare workbench.
Make sure you have all the tools needed for glueing:

* a lot of clamps (5 - 10 small clamps)
* Sandpaper or fine file
* small screwdriver
* cutter knife
* express wood glue

image::prepare_workbench_and_tools.jpg[]

=== Prepare the wood parts for glueing.
Gently remove the remaining loose parts and price stickers, if any present. Depending on the laser cut depth, it may appear that remaining parts (clippings) must be removed carefully with a cutter knife or sandpaper.

Approximated time needed: 5 - 10 minutes

=== Glue the parts together.
Glue the parts together preferably using express wood glue. Apply glue uniformly following the recommendations of the specific glue user manual.

image::apply_glue_uniformly.jpg[]
image::ready_for_glueing.jpg[]

Use many small clamps to apply appropriate pressure distributed on the full surface. Use some of M4 screws to hold the parts in place and assure that the parts are nicely aligned before the glue gets dry.

image::clamping_parts.jpg[]
image::align_and_fix_with_screw.jpg[]

Let the assembly dry for some time with the clamps attached. Follow specific instructions depending on the glue you are using. Remove remaining glue _after_ drying. Since otherwise smeared adhesive on the wood parts can not be painted well.

image::excessive_glue.jpg[]

Glueing takes approximately *10 - 15* minutes per part. But drying will probably take *1 - 2* hours depending on the glue you are using. Repeat the process for all wooden parts, i.e. one lower torso, two thighs, two shanks.

The result should look like this:

== Coloring

Color is of course optional but gives your Gretchen an individual character. Nonetheless it is recommended to apply some clear coat to protect the wooden parts from humidity and fat.

image::coloring_parts_start.jpg[]

=== Paint the parts
We recommend coloring the surfaces of the wooden parts and leave the nicely burned laser cut edges unpainted.

image::coloring_parts_doing.jpg[]

For instance we painted the outer surfaces orange and the inner surfaces antrazit.

image::coloring_parts_orange.jpg[]
image::coloring_parts_antrazit.jpg[]

In the end it could look like this:

image::coloring_parts_ready.jpg[]

=== Applying clear coat

After coloring or coating the wooden parts for the first time, little bristles come up and the surface feels very rough and bristly.
Before finishing with the last coating layer, carefully use sandpaper to make the surface smooth without removing the color.

image::coloring_parts_clearcoat.jpg[]

== Assembly

Assembly is done in several steps. Although there are many possible ways to assemble, we recommend the order given in the manual.

=== Bearings

We begin the assembly with mounting the bearings. You need:

* all five wooden parts
* 16 bearings KFL08
* 16 screws M4 x 25 mm
* 16 lock nuts M4
* 32 spring washers M4
* an M4 hex screw driver and complementary a spanner

Note: If you consider to use an electric screw driver we recommend using torque control.

image::prepare_bearing_mounting.jpg[]

Before starting, make sure to remove remaining glue from the screw holes. Use a drill or hex screw driver to remove the dried glue.

image::remove_glue_in_holes.jpg[]

The bearings are self-aligning, i.e. they can change their axes' direction. Bearings must be properly aligned, to guarantee a solid belt tension later. You should initially move the bearings once to slightly loosen the connection and more easily correct the alignment.

image::centering_bearings.jpg[]

Mount the bearings on both sides (dual bearing) using the M4 x 25 mm screws as shown in the picture. You should only tighten the screws loosely in the first place and than correct the axis to be perpendicular to the surface.

image::assemble_loosly.jpg[]

Check the proper rotation of the axes.

image::check_bearing.jpg[]

After proper centering the bearing, tighten screws. The final result should look like this.

=== Knee

The next step is mounting the knees. Prepare workbench by compiling the needed parts (per knee):

* shank with bearings
* knee inner
* knee outer (with integrated tooth belt pulley)
* 2x M4 x 40 mm screws
* 1x M4 x 30 mm screw

Tools:

* (electric) screwdriver,
* clamp (optional),
* M5 drill (optional)

image::prepare_mounting_knee.jpg[]

Insert the 3 screws into the outer knee part (with pulley). Insert only as deep as the screw tips are barely visible, just enough to find the corresponding hole in the wooden part.

image::knee_mounting_0.jpg[]

Screw the two parts together. Probably pressing the part down to the workbench might help to get the screws inserted. Again, turn only as far as the tips of the screws are barely visible.

image::knee_mounting_1.jpg[]

Carefully sinking the holes of the inner side of the second plastic part with a drill of size 5mm will help the screws _finding_ the holes. Sink less than 1mm.

image::knee_mounting_sink_hole.jpg[]

Mount the second part, optionally using a clamp, to have the parts perfectly aligned. Since there are no dedicated nuts here, don't turn to fast and powerful, the screw will create their own thread into the plastic, which must be preserved.

image::knee_mounting_2.jpg[]

After mounting the knee, the result should look like this. Again, don't overturn here. Use torque limiter on your electric screwdriver.

image::knee_mountin_ready_0.jpg[]

Repeat the process with the second knee.

=== Foot
